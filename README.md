## Finance platform for portfolio monitoring and quantitative research.

There are three main features at the moment:
  1) A balance sheet for personal finance
  2) A portofolio monitoring
  3) A research dashboard

The balance sheet contains all incomes and expenses over the year.

The portfolio monitoring gathers all long positions that you have. It shows various equity metrics (P/E, PEG, dividends, etc...) and how diversified you are accross assets. There is a colour code according to the GARP investing strategy.

The research dashboard contains several features used for understanding your assets: historical prices with SMAs, log return distributions, correlations.
